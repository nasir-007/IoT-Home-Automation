## ðŸ“– Overview
This project focuses on building a **smart IoT-based home automation system** with an **automatic water pump controller** using the **ESP32 NodeMCU**.  

The system enables:
- Remote and manual control of home appliances (2 bulbs, 1 fan, 1 water pump).  
- Automatic water pump control using a **ultrasonic sonar sensor** to measure water level.  
- Environmental monitoring with **DHT11 (temperature & humidity)** and **rain sensor** for weather conditions.  
- Both **auto** and **manual** modes using physical switches or your mobail application.  
- Real-time updates through IoT dashboard (mobile/web).  

This provides a **low-cost, efficient, and user-friendly** smart home solution.
